## Pyrate
Even hipster pirates love gold and women.

## What is it?
Small threading library that supports channel-like communication between Lua states.

## How does it work?
[See for yourself](https://github.com/vapourismo/pyrate/blob/master/example.lua)

## How to build and install?
 - Clone repository
 - Run `make`
 - Copy the `pyrate.so` into your `LUA_CPATH`

## Note
I've tested this on Lua 5.1 only. Good luck with any other version.
